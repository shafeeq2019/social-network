## Config
You have to create a virtual environment for the backend and install all dependencies.

## Deploy
Backend: You have to use a Python hosting service. I personally prefer www.pythonanywhere.com.
Frontend: You only need to add your web app's Firebase configuration to `./frontend/src/firebase.ts` and provide your server URL in `./frontend/.env`.


## Build Setup for Backend
```bash
# Python backend setup
cd backend/

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment (for Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate the virtual environment (for MacOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Install backend dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Build Setup for Frontend
```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production with minification
npm run build

# Build & deploy on Firebase
npm run deploy

```
